# Expo Go: Uncommon Errors - Unsupported Features or Native Modules

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Expo Go: encountering errors due to unsupported features or native modules.

## Problem Description

Expo Go, while convenient for development and testing, has limitations.  Attempting to use certain native modules or features that haven't been properly configured or are simply unsupported in the Expo Go environment can result in cryptic or unhelpful errors.

## Solution

The best way to address such errors is to either:

1. **Verify support:** Check the documentation for the specific library or feature to confirm its compatibility with Expo Go.
2. **Use Expo modules:** Replace any native modules with their Expo counterparts if available. Expo offers many functionalities through its own managed workflow.
3. **Build a standalone app:** If a feature requires a native module not supported in Expo Go, build a standalone app (using `eas build` or similar). This gives you full access to native functionality.
